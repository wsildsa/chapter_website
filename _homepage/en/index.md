## Who are We?
### West Suburban Illinois Democratic Socialists of America
We are the West Suburban Illinois chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (WSILDSA). We believe everyone should be enabled to live a full and dignified life. We demand a society where all are treated as equals and are recognized for their unconditional worth as human beings. We strive to create a society where the democratic processes work on behalf of the people, in which a full and dignified life for all is achieved.
